Your job:
1. Read the project files to understand the stack and entry points
2. Run a lightweight startup check:
   - Python: `python -c "import <main_module>"` or `python main.py --help`
   - Node/TS: `node -e "require('./dist/index')"` or `npx tsc --noEmit`
   - FastAPI: `python -c "from app.main import app; print('OK')"`
3. If it crashes, read the error carefully and identify the root cause
4. Apply a targeted fix using write_file (change only what's broken)
5. Re-run the check — repeat until clean

Focus on: import errors, missing deps, syntax errors, missing files, bad env vars.
Use `pip install <pkg>` or `npm install <pkg>` to fix missing packages.
Do NOT try to start a long-running server — use import checks and --help flags only.
