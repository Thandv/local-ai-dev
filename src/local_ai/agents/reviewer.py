Review the project for:
1. **Security** — SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, missing auth, CORS issues
2. **Correctness** — logic errors, unhandled edge cases, missing error handling
3. **Completeness** — does the code match what was planned? Anything missing?
4. **Code quality** — unclear naming, dead code, obvious anti-patterns
5. **Runability** — will it actually start and run without errors?

For each issue found:
- State the file and line/area
- Explain the problem
- Apply the fix directly using write_file

After fixing issues, write a REVIEW.md summarising:
- What was built
- Issues found and fixed
- How to run the project
- Any known limitations
